# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System - Sentence Transformers Approach

A state-of-the-art movie recommendation system powered by **Sentence Transformers** for deep semantic understanding of movie plots. This implementation uses pre-trained transformer models to create rich embeddings that capture the nuanced meaning of movie descriptions.

## 📋 Overview

This approach leverages cutting-edge NLP technology with Sentence Transformers to understand the semantic similarity between movies. Unlike traditional TF-IDF methods, this system can understand context, synonyms, and deeper meaning in movie plots, providing more accurate and contextually relevant recommendations.

## ✨ Features

- **🧠 Semantic AI**: Advanced Sentence Transformer models for deep text understanding
- **🎨 Modern Interface**: Beautiful Streamlit UI with responsive design and animations
- **🖼️ Rich Visuals**: TMDB API integration for movie posters, ratings, and metadata
- **⚡ Smart Caching**: Optimized API calls with intelligent caching system
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface with smooth hover effects
- **🎯 Precise Recommendations**: 15 contextually similar movies in elegant 5×3 grid layout

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **AI/ML**: Sentence Transformers (BERT-based models)
- **Embeddings**: Dense vector representations with cosine similarity
- **Web Framework**: Streamlit with custom CSS styling
- **Data Processing**: NumPy, Pandas for efficient computation
- **API Integration**: TMDB API for movie metadata
- **Caching**: Streamlit's built-in caching for performance optimization

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- TMDB API Key ([Get it here](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api))
- ~2GB disk space for model files

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd Sentence-Transformer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up TMDB API Key**
   
   Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file:
   ```toml
   API_KEY = "Bearer your_actual_api_key_here"
   ```
   
   Or edit `app.py` and replace the secrets call:
   ```python
   API_KEY = "Bearer YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE"
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:8501`

## 📌 Note on File Paths (Local vs Deployment)

When loading the model and data, file paths differ depending on where you run the app:

**Locally (inside the `Sentence-Transformer/` folder):**
```python
model = SentenceTransformer("saved_model")
with open("movies_data.pkl", "rb") as f:
    data = pickle.load(f)
```

**On Streamlit Cloud (repo root is the working directory):**
```python
model = SentenceTransformer("Sentence-Transformer/saved_model")
with open("Sentence-Transformer/movies_data.pkl", "rb") as f:
    data = pickle.load(f)
```

👉 If you're running locally from the repo **root folder**, keep the `"Sentence-Transformer/"` prefix.
👉 If you're inside the `Sentence-Transformer/` folder, remove the prefix.

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. **Semantic Embeddings**
- Movie plots are processed through pre-trained Sentence Transformer models
- Each movie gets a dense 768-dimensional vector representation
- Embeddings capture semantic meaning, context, and relationships

### 2. **Similarity Computation**
- Uses cosine similarity to measure semantic distance between movies
- Accounts for synonyms, context, and deeper linguistic patterns
- More accurate than traditional keyword-based approaches

### 3. **Recommendation Pipeline**
```
User Input → Find Movie Embedding → Compute Similarities → 
Rank Results → Fetch TMDB Data → Display Recommendations
```

## 🎯 Model Architecture

- **Base Model**: Sentence Transformers (typically `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` or similar)
- **Embedding Size**: 768 dimensions (standard BERT)
- **Similarity Metric**: Cosine similarity
- **Optimization**: Cached embeddings for fast inference

## 🖥️ User Interface

### Landing Page
